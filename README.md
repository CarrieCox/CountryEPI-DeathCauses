## Project Overview 
In this group project my team and I utitlized Tableau to conduct visualization analysis on how deaths attributed to Acute Hepatitis, diarrheal diseases, and digestive disease. We compared the percent of deaths per country population to each country's EPI score. An EPI score (Environmental Performance Index) takes into account water quality and sanitation levels. 

## Data Description
 We used a data set on causes of death in the world from 1990-2019 from kaggle.com. This file had 32 causes of death, we chose to focus on the three that can be a result of poor water quality and sanitation. We used another data set of world population, from worldometer, to compare each country's death count on a relative scale.
 
 ## Analysis Conclusions 
 - Diarrheal diseases and Acute Hepatitis deaths are more prevalent in countries with low EPI scores.
 - Digestive diseases ahve the highest amount of deaths and is increasing, but does not seem to correlate with EPI score. 
 - Countries in Eastern and Western Africa and South Asia have the highest amount of deaths from Diarrheal Diseases and Acute Hepatitis. These countries are also in regions of low EPI scores.
